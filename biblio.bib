	abstract = {This paper introduces a new efficient algorithm for computing Gr\"{o}bner bases. We replace the Buchberger criteria by an optimal criteria. We give a proof that the resulting algorithm (called F5) generates no useless critical pairs if the input is a regular sequence. This a new result by itself but a first implementation of the algorithm F5 shows that it is also very efficient in practice: for instance previously untractable problems can be solved (cyclic 10). In practice for most examples there is no reduction to zero. We illustrate this algorithm by one detailed example.},

	abstract = {We present a general construction of a zero-knowledge proof for an NP relation R(x,w) which only makes a black-box use of a secure protocol for a related multi-partyfunctionality f. The latter protocol is only required to be secure against a small number of "honest but curious" players. As an application, we can translate previous results on the efficiency of secure multiparty computation to the domain of zero-knowledge, improving over previous constructions of efficient zero-knowledge proofs. In particular, if verifying R on a witness of length m can be done by a circuit C of size s, and assuming one-way functions exist, we get the following types of zero-knowledge proof protocols.Approaching the witness length. If C has constant depth over ∧,∨,⊕, - gates of unbounded fan-in, we get a zero-knowledge protocol with communication complexity m·poly(k)·polylog(s), where k is a security parameter. Such a protocol can be implemented in either the standard interactive model or, following a trusted setup, in a non-interactive model."Constant-rate" zero-knowledge. For an arbitrary circuit C of size s and a bounded fan-in, we geta zero-knowledge protocol with communication complexity O(s)+poly(k). Thus, for large circuits, the ratio between the communication complexity and the circuit size approaches a constant. This improves over the O(ks) complexity of the best previous protocols.},

	abstract = {Solving multihomogeneous systems, as a wide range of structured algebraic systems occurring frequently in practical problems, is of first importance. Experimentally, solving these systems with Gröbner bases algorithms seems to be easier than solving homogeneous systems of the same degree. Nevertheless, the reasons for this behaviour are not clear. In this paper, we focus on bilinear systems (i.e. bihomogeneous systems where all equations have bidegree (1,1)). Our goal is to provide a theoretical explanation of the aforementioned experimental behaviour and to propose new techniques to speed up the Gröbner basis computations by using the multihomogeneous structure of those systems. The contributions are theoretical and practical. First, we adapt the classical F5 criterion to avoid reductions to zero which occur when the input is a set of bilinear polynomials. We also prove an explicit form of the Hilbert series of bihomogeneous ideals generated by generic bilinear polynomials and give a new upper bound on the degree of regularity of generic affine bilinear systems. We propose also a variant of the F5 Algorithm dedicated to multihomogeneous systems which exploits a structural property of the Macaulay matrix which occurs on such inputs. Experimental results show that this variant requires less time and memory than the classical homogeneous F5 Algorithm. Lastly, we investigate the complexity of computing a Gröbner basis for the grevlex ordering of a generic 0-dimensional affine bilinear system over k[x1,…,xnx,y1,…,yny]. In particular, we show that this complexity is upper bounded by O(nx+ny+min(nx+1,ny+1)min(nx+1,ny+1)ω), which is polynomial in nx+ny (i.e. the number of unknowns) when min(nx,ny) is constant.}

We give a bound on the number of polynomials of degree d in a Gröbner basis computed by Faugère's F5 algorithm (2002) in this generic case for the grevlex ordering (which is also a bound on the number of polynomials for a reduced Gröbner basis, independently of the algorithm used). Next, we analyse more precisely the structure of the polynomials in the Gröbner bases with signatures that F5 computes and use it to bound the complexity of the algorithm. Our estimates show that the version of F5 we analyse, which uses only standard Gaussian elimination techniques, outperforms row reduction of the Macaulay matrix with the best known algorithms for moderate degrees, and even for degrees up to the thousands if Strassen's multiplication is used. The degree being fixed, the factor of improvement grows exponentially with the number of variables.}
