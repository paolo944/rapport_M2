	abstract = {This paper introduces a new efficient algorithm for computing Gr\"{o}bner bases. We replace the Buchberger criteria by an optimal criteria. We give a proof that the resulting algorithm (called F5) generates no useless critical pairs if the input is a regular sequence. This a new result by itself but a first implementation of the algorithm F5 shows that it is also very efficient in practice: for instance previously untractable problems can be solved (cyclic 10). In practice for most examples there is no reduction to zero. We illustrate this algorithm by one detailed example.},

	abstract = {We present a general construction of a zero-knowledge proof for an NP relation R(x,w) which only makes a black-box use of a secure protocol for a related multi-partyfunctionality f. The latter protocol is only required to be secure against a small number of "honest but curious" players. As an application, we can translate previous results on the efficiency of secure multiparty computation to the domain of zero-knowledge, improving over previous constructions of efficient zero-knowledge proofs. In particular, if verifying R on a witness of length m can be done by a circuit C of size s, and assuming one-way functions exist, we get the following types of zero-knowledge proof protocols.Approaching the witness length. If C has constant depth over ∧,∨,⊕, - gates of unbounded fan-in, we get a zero-knowledge protocol with communication complexity m·poly(k)·polylog(s), where k is a security parameter. Such a protocol can be implemented in either the standard interactive model or, following a trusted setup, in a non-interactive model."Constant-rate" zero-knowledge. For an arbitrary circuit C of size s and a bounded fan-in, we geta zero-knowledge protocol with communication complexity O(s)+poly(k). Thus, for large circuits, the ratio between the communication complexity and the circuit size approaches a constant. This improves over the O(ks) complexity of the best previous protocols.},

	abstract = {Solving multihomogeneous systems, as a wide range of structured algebraic systems occurring frequently in practical problems, is of first importance. Experimentally, solving these systems with Gröbner bases algorithms seems to be easier than solving homogeneous systems of the same degree. Nevertheless, the reasons for this behaviour are not clear. In this paper, we focus on bilinear systems (i.e. bihomogeneous systems where all equations have bidegree (1,1)). Our goal is to provide a theoretical explanation of the aforementioned experimental behaviour and to propose new techniques to speed up the Gröbner basis computations by using the multihomogeneous structure of those systems. The contributions are theoretical and practical. First, we adapt the classical F5 criterion to avoid reductions to zero which occur when the input is a set of bilinear polynomials. We also prove an explicit form of the Hilbert series of bihomogeneous ideals generated by generic bilinear polynomials and give a new upper bound on the degree of regularity of generic affine bilinear systems. We propose also a variant of the F5 Algorithm dedicated to multihomogeneous systems which exploits a structural property of the Macaulay matrix which occurs on such inputs. Experimental results show that this variant requires less time and memory than the classical homogeneous F5 Algorithm. Lastly, we investigate the complexity of computing a Gröbner basis for the grevlex ordering of a generic 0-dimensional affine bilinear system over k[x1,…,xnx,y1,…,yny]. In particular, we show that this complexity is upper bounded by O(nx+ny+min(nx+1,ny+1)min(nx+1,ny+1)ω), which is polynomial in nx+ny (i.e. the number of unknowns) when min(nx,ny) is constant.}

Next, we analyse more precisely the structure of the polynomials in the Gröbner bases with signatures that F5 computes and use it to bound the complexity of the algorithm. Our estimates show that the version of F5 we analyse, which uses only standard Gaussian elimination techniques, outperforms row reduction of the Macaulay matrix with the best known algorithms for moderate degrees, and even for degrees up to the thousands if Strassen's multiplication is used. The degree being fixed, the factor of improvement grows exponentially with the number of variables.}

	abstract = {In 1965 Buchberger introduced an algorithmic approach to compute Gröbner bases. Later on, he and many others presented various attempts to improve the computation by removing useless elements a priori. One approach, initiated by Gebauer, Möller, Mora and Traverso in the 1990s, is to keep track of the corresponding syzygies which is related to the topic of this survey: signature-based algorithms for Gröbner bases. This area was initiated by Faugère's F5 algorithm in 2002. The general idea of signatures is to keep track of the history of the computation with a minimal overhead and to exploit this information to detect redundant elements. Here we give a summary of the literature on signature-based algorithms and show how to classify known algorithms by 3 different orderings. For this we give translations between different notations and show the relationships (differences and similarities) among many approaches. Moreover, we give a general description of how the idea of signatures is quite natural when performing the reduction process using linear algebra. We hope that this survey would help to outline this field of active research.}

We give an algorithm that reduces the problem to a combination of exhaustive search and sparse linear algebra. This algorithm has several variants depending on the method used for the linear algebra step. We show that, under precise algebraic assumptions on the input system, the deterministic variant of our algorithm has complexity bounded by O(20.841n) when m=n, while a probabilistic variant of the Las Vegas type has expected complexity O(20.792n). Experiments on random systems show that the algebraic assumptions are satisfied with probability very close to 1. We also give a rough estimate for the actual threshold between our method and exhaustive search, which is as low as 200, and thus very relevant for cryptographic applications.}

For d = 2, the best-known algorithm for the problem is by Bardet et al. [J. Complexity, 2013] and was shown to run in time O(20.792n) under assumptions that were experimentally found to hold for random equation systems. The best-known worst-case algorithm for the problem is due to Björklund et al. [ICALP'19]. It runs in time O(20.804n) for d = 2 and O(2(1-1/(2.7d))n) for d > 2. In this paper, we devise a worst-case algorithm that improves the one by Björklund et al. It runs in time O(20.6943n) (or O(1.6181n)) for d = 2 and O(2(1–1/(2d))n) for d > 2. Our algorithm thus outperforms all known worst-case algorithms, as well as ones analyzed for random equation systems. We also devise a second algorithm that outputs all solutions to a polynomial system and has similar complexity to the first (provided that the number of solutions is not too large). A central idea in the work of Björklund et al. was to reduce the problem of finding a solution to a polynomial system over to the problem of counting the parity of all solutions. A parity-counting instance was then reduced to many smaller parity-counting instances. Our main observation is that these smaller instances are related and can be solved more efficiently by a new algorithm to a problem which we call multiple parity-counting. }

For every integer k ≥ 2 and finite field 𝔽q where q = pd for a prime p, we give, to the best of our knowledge, the first algorithms that achieve an exponential speedup over the brute force O(qn) time algorithm in the worst case. We present two algorithms, a randomized algorithm with running time qn+o(n) · q−n/O(k) time if q ≤ 24ekd, and [EQUATION] otherwise, where e = 2.718... is Napier's constant, and a deterministic algorithm for counting solutions with running time qn+o(n) ·q−n/O(kq6/7d). For the important special case of quadratic equations in 𝔽2, our randomized algorithm has running time O(20.8765n).For systems over 𝔽2 we also consider the case where the input polynomials do not have bounded degree, but instead can be efficiently represented as a ΣΠΣ circuit, i.e., a sum of products of sums of variables. For this case we present a deterministic algorithm running in time 2n−δn for δ = 1/O(log(s/n)) for instances with s product gates in total and n variables.Our algorithms adapt several techniques recently developed via the polynomial method from circuit complexity. The algorithm for systems of ΣΠΣ polynomials also introduces a new degree reduction method that takes an instance of the problem and outputs a subexponential-sized set of instances, in such a way that feasibility is preserved and every polynomial among the output instances has degree O(log(s/n)).},
