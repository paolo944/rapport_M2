	abstract = {This paper introduces a new efficient algorithm for computing Gr\"{o}bner bases. We replace the Buchberger criteria by an optimal criteria. We give a proof that the resulting algorithm (called F5) generates no useless critical pairs if the input is a regular sequence. This a new result by itself but a first implementation of the algorithm F5 shows that it is also very efficient in practice: for instance previously untractable problems can be solved (cyclic 10). In practice for most examples there is no reduction to zero. We illustrate this algorithm by one detailed example.},

	abstract = {We prove NP-hardness of six families of naturally defined, interesting board games. Some of them are “only just hard” in the sense that slight variations of them are polynomial. We further prove NP-completeness of two problems on digraphs which are related to game strategies; and NP-completeness and NP-hardness respectively of two classical problems of abstract algebra concerning the existence of solutions of algebraic equations. Also these problems were suggested by an investigation in combinatorial game theory.}
